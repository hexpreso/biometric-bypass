This LSPosed module streamlines face unlock by skipping the confirmation step enforced after biometric authentication. It applies the bypass system-wide — so it works across **all apps**, including banking or security-sensitive ones.

Android introduced the [`setConfirmationRequired(false)`](https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/biometric-auth#no-explicit-user-action) flag in Android 10 to support passive authentication flows (e.g., face unlock without requiring a tap). Since most apps don’t disable confirmation explicitly, Android defaults to requiring a manual tap, turning face unlock into a two-step chore.

This module ensures the confirmation step is skipped across all biometric flows, regardless of app implementation.
