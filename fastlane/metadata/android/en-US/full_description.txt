<p>This LSPosed module streamlines face unlock by skipping the confirmation step enforced after biometric authentication. It applies the bypass system-wide — so it works across <strong>all apps</strong>, including banking or security-sensitive ones.</p><p>Android introduced the <a href="https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/biometric-auth#no-explicit-user-action"><code>setConfirmationRequired(false)</code></a> flag in Android 10 to support passive authentication flows (e.g., face unlock without requiring a tap). Since most apps don’t disable confirmation explicitly, Android defaults to requiring a manual tap, turning face unlock into a two-step chore.</p><p>This module ensures the confirmation step is skipped across all biometric flows, regardless of app implementation.</p>
